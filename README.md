# Beauty in Numbers: Predicting Sephora Product Ratings with Machine Learning

This is a data science project that analyzes product data from Sephora, a popular cosmetics retailer. The project uses various data cleaning, exploration, and modeling techniques to gain insights into the factors that influence product ratings. The project also includes a feature importance analysis using machine learning algorithms to identify the most important features that contribute to ratings. The results of this analysis can help Sephora and other cosmetics retailers better understand their customers' preferences and make data-driven decisions to improve their product offerings.

## Data Source
Data for this project was obtained from the "All Products Available on Sephora Website" dataset on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/raghadalharbi/all-products-available-on-sephora-website).
